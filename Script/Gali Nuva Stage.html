<li>Turaga Nokama: Toa... Gali?</li>
<li>Gali Nuva: I may be changed, Turaga Nokama, but my love for my people remains the same.</li>
<li>Turaga Nokama: And yet, all is not well. The Bohrok Kal are a more fearsome foe then we (have) ever seen. They are threating to overcome us all!</li>
<li>Gali Nuva: Do not fear. My Nuva power can overcome any obstacle.</li>
<p>The game does not feature any more dialougue until later when Gali encounters a Ga-Matoran.</p>
<li>Ga-Matoran: The Ga-Matoran are hiding all around us... When in the water, you can hold Y to swim fast and Double Jump to leap out of the water and explore the Wahi.</li>
<h5>This part of the game features a lot of Ga-Matorans scattered all over the place, some with their own dialogue. they can be gotten in vaired order, so the true in-order script is impossible to decide. so the dialogue will just be listed as if this is the proper order.</h5>

<li>Ga-Matoran: Our Sister is trapped in that dark-energy cage, we can't get her out. Only the strongest of blasts could crack it open. You must fully charge your energy with B then immedeatly press Y to activate your Nuva blast."</li>
<li>Other Ga-Matoran: Wow, you can really swim fast. I heard, the higher up you can get, the deeper you can dive? That's so cool!</li>

<li>Gali Nuva: Chronicler!</li>
<li>Chronicler: I have seen them. Strange new creatures - dark, and... They flew towards Onu-Wahi.</li>
