<li>Tahu: Kopaka,(Tahu looks at Kopaka) my brother. I(Tahu looks ahead of himself) have discovered the secret of the Bohrok's(Tahu looks at Kopaka) power, and(Tahu looks ahead of himself) it is also their weakness. capture(Tahu looks at Kopaka) the Krana!(Tahu looks ahead of himself)</li>
<li>Kopaka: Im(Tahu looks at Kopaka) chasing a Bohrok now. Hes heading for the Kini. There isnt much time.</li>
<p>The game does not feature any more dialougue until after Kopaka finishes showing off his sledding skills, and makes it to the Kini</p>
<li>Turaga Nuju: Toa Kopaka, the Bohrok has burrowed through that cliff. I fear it's heading for Ko-Koro</li>
<p>The game does not feature any more dialougue until after Kopaka rams into the Bohrok with his shield, knocks it into the air, and murders it, and is now at Ko-Koro</p>
<li>Turaga Nuju again, somehow: Kopaka, Toa of Ice, you have saved our Koro and we thank you. Alas, the swarm leader has escaped, fleeing down the mountain. The path down the mountain is most treacherous. there have been many unnatural landslides there of late. Take care.</li>
<li>Kopaka: I will do my sworn duty.</li>
<p>The game does not feature any more dialougue until after Kopaka escapes from a conveniently placed boulder pushed down by a random Tah-nak. this was veiwed by 2 Ko-Matoran i think, i can't tell.</p>
<li>I think it's a Ko-Matoran: I tried to warn you about the boulder, but i was too late. (has a mental breakdown,) The Bohrok has fled into that cave.</li>
<p>The game does not feature any more dialougue until after Kopaka defeats the swarm leader. and takes it's Krana (and is somehow unaffected by it).</p>
<li>I must return to the others at once!</li>
<p>End of Kopaka's Stage</p>
