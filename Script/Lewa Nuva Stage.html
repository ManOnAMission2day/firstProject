<li>Gali Nuva: Toa Lewa, you know what news I bring?</li>
<li>Lewa Nuva: The drums if Le-Koro crytell of... sons of Makuta. But without my Suva, I cannot reach the threat.</li>
<li>Gali Nuva: Where are your Matoran, to activate the Suva?</li>
<li>Lewa Nuva: Captured... lost...</li>
<li>Gali Nuva: you alone can find them, Lewa Nuva! Find them, free them, and use the Suva to hunt fo these... sons of Makuta.</li>
<li>Lewa Nuva: Heartpromise, sister!</li>
<p>The game does not feature any more dialougue until later when Lewa Nuva has rescued all the Matorans, activated his Suva, and went down a balloon elevator and the footage cuts to a random rakshi.</p>
<li>Rakshi: (does animation for scream) then, one second later, RRRRRAAAHH</li>
<p>The game does not feature any more dialougue until after Lewa Nuva has suffered with the Great Gukko bird, and encountered the Rakshi, who lets out another scream exactly like the last one, and then Lewa tricks him into drowning, and he somehow drops a Krana.</p>
<li>Lewa Nuva: Ahh. Eeaahh!</li>
<p>End of Lewa's Stage</p>
