<li>All Six Toa: (cheering)</li>
<li>Turaga Vakama: And the great being sent us the Toa to defeat Makuta and banish darkness from Mata Nui, Raising him from slumber. only the mighty Toa are able to remove the taint of Makuta-</li>
<p>(cut to a blue matoran running through tall grass somewhere else)</p>
<li>Blue Matoran: Hhahhhahhhahhhah</li>
<p>(Cut back to Turaga Vakama)</p>
<li>Turaga Vakama: -from the Rahi.</li>
<li>All Six Toa:(cheering)</li>
<li>Kopaka: Yeah!</li>
<li>Lewa: Hahahahaha.</li>
<li>Onua: Nicely done.</li>
<p>(blue matoran runs in, gasping for breath)</p>
<li>Blue Matoran: Help. Something...Something is chasing me. You have to stop it!</li>
<li>Gali, completly ignoring what the blue Matoran said: What's that noise?</li>
<li>Tahu, doing the same: I don't know, but i don't think it's friendly.</li>
<p>Then, Rahi that just showed up from a completly different direction then where the Blue matoran came from start destroying eveything. Then, in the heat of battle and destruction, cut to Onua.</p>
<li>Onua: Makuta lives?</li>
<p>Then, the Bohrok show up</p>
<li>Tahu: you will not harm the Matoran while the power of Mata Nui still flows through my being.</li>
<p>The Bohrok shoot one attack at him, which is deflected by his shield, then the Bohrok run away.</p>
<li>Lewa: Ill save you. (Jumps over to Matoran who were not on screen and deflects attack from Rahi who also was not on screen. Rahi also leave after that.)</li>
<li>Gali: We are in great danger. let us traval back to our wahi and deal with Makutas dark threat once and for all.</li>
